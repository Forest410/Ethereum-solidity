# Lottery React App

This is a project-specific README I created for the lottery-react app developed in the udemy.com course [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/). In the course the instructor makes use of the previous approach of installing `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`. This is no longer the recommended approach. As such, I bootstrapped my setup of the project using one of the new recommended methods, specifically, I used the Yarn command:

```bash
yarn create react-app lottery-react
```
